    <h1>Vision Express</h1>
    
    <p>One of the first e-commerce custom solution designed as a responsive web design from the ground up. Launched as a Minimum Viable Product and developed into a customer’s digital experience system.</p>
    
    <p>My role was UX research coordination: usability studies with eye tracking and in-depth interview elements—done as a benchmark and with an Axure prototype. The research was facilitated by external contractors at a usability lab.</p>
    
    <p>We did a field studies and stores, to understand how visits are managed by staff so we could design a better solution for their needs and context of their everyday work.</p>
    
    <p>I was also directing UX design (workshops with the client and internal teams, oversight of web production with RWD principles) and I have created an interactive prototype in Axure.</p>
    
    <p>The outcomes:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>e-commerce that was easy to use, with a conversion rate or 5% (processed purchases),</li>
      
      <li>application to manage in-store visits across 160 brick and mortar location across Poland.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This project was launched in 2012, and although a different software house supports the project right now, the project still stands and is still in use.</p>

    <h1>FROØPT</h1>
    
    <p>FRØPTs are custom fronts for IKEA kitchen cabinets. The challenge was to create an e-commerce and communication website.</p>
    
    <p>I was responsible for the strategy for the product, UX design direction, UI design, usability research, and web production.</p>
    
    <p>Due to the complexity of available sizes of the cabinets, no existing e-commerce solution could have been used.</p>
    
    <p>So… back to sketches for me, and into some in-depth interviews with existing clients…</p>
    
    <p>Although the business side was focused, the configurator was not easy to design. The number of options, the order of the steps and choices—a lot of elements were interdependent.</p>
    
    <p>After the launch, the first orders happened in the first weeks, and FRØPT clients expressed their satisfaction with calm and simple communication as well as an intuitive flow—although, I must admit, that I see a lot of things that can be improved, when the right time comes.</p>
    
    <p>The project still evolves, and the FRØPT business and co-founders were recognised by furniture and interior design industries and had received awards and stories about custom, high-quality cabinets, where published in many magazines.</p>
    
    <p>The back office helps to organise the sales and delivery process.</p>

    <h1>miastologia</h1>
    
    <p>A 3-year long project to bring well-designed apartments as affordable housing, without losing the quality of the interior and comfort of living. Easier said than done—and done.</p>
    
    <p>I was responsible for digital products:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Communication website—contrary to competition, we decided to put a fully transparent offer online, with easy to understand pricing model and no hidden costs. There were a lot of pieces of information to be included and a lot of reading for the people, but the availability and simplicity of the website enabled people to go through every detail that mattered to them.</li>
      
      <li>Back office—the goal was to bring the sales process online, and to everything internally (without hiring external real estate agents). The flows were complicated due to a lot of legislation related to the real estate market.</li>
      
      <li>Apartment configurator—an app that allowed people to make a reservation, select options for topology and fit-out and prepare for notary agreement. Apartments were modular, so one bigger apartment (M-4) took the place of two smaller ones (M-2)—it was a peoples choice, which of those will be purchased and eventually build.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Apart from digital, I was doing service design, like the experience with showroom, sales flow, and even the wayfinding and navigation in the space.</p>
    
    <p>My responsibility was also to hire, oversight and direct work of a digital agency (later I hired a full stack developer internally) and to co-operate with branding agency.</p>
    
    <p>During the 3 years, we had interview in-person more than 200 people who visited our showroom (build in 1:1 scale M-2 apartment)—this impacted our understanding of peoples decision process and needs significantly. It also helped to improve the ergonomics of the flats.</p>
    
    <p>The research activities included competitive reports, field observations and a ton of desk research. As for the digital products, we had used analytics and interactions recording to identify struggles people might have had with the website and apps.</p>
    
    <p>As the miastologia team was multidisciplinary, everyone has worn many hats, so I also did illustrations and posters.</p>

      <figcaption>A presentation made as a kickoff for a new product feature (covers roadmap strategy, users insights mapped with Value Proposition Canvas and is a starting point for UX work and business decisions):</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>The primary outcomes for the project were:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Most people who are not moving in or renting their apartments are satisfied with their experience and investment.</li>
      
      <li>People bought their apartments online—that was a significant change compared to the market status quo.</li>
      
      <li>The back office investment broke even after the first location sold out.</li>
      
      <li>A complicated product structure did not negatively impact the experiences of configuration the apartments.</li>
      
      <li>miastologia is now perceived as an innovator at the real estate market—after only 3 years of operations.</li>
    </ul>
