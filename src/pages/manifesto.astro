			Every project, team, and organisation is different, but some things stay constant. Below is a list of things I find true or important: my tenets and guiding principles.

		<ol class="roman">
			<li>Family and friends are most important. Life needs balance. We are social beings.</li>
			<li>Learning is a lifetime activity. Curiosity gives momentum.</li>
			<li>Good questions are more interesting than readily available answers.</li>
			<li>Understanding is more important than tools.</li>
			<li>Progress over a process. Process over assumptions and <i>how we did it before</i>.</li>
			<li>Every job needs a pursuit of perfectionâ€”which is unreachable. Good enough is enough.</li>
			<li>The big picture is a starting point for crafting details.</li>
			<li>Trust, honesty, and transparency must be a part of every collaboration.</li>
			<li>Every business is about profit, but money should never be the ultimate goal.</li>
			<li>The best things are created by teams. Individuals make a difference.</li>
			<li>Everyone is creative. Execution is priceless. Ideas are worthless, but the good ones are rare.</li>
			<li>People can do great things, but they need the support of environments that provide them with psychological safety.</li>
			<li>Every person must be treated with respect. Apart from hateful bigots.</li>
			<li>Nothing is simple, but we can make things clear. That is design.</li>
