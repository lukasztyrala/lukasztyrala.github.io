				I am driven by curiosity and constant learning. I work with integrity, attention to detail, and humility toward the complexity of our world and humans.
			</p>
			<p>
				I strongly believe in the power of research, conceptualisation, creativity, and collaboration, all modelled around a process of forming ideas, making decisions and fast execution to learn based on experimentation.

				I am based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraków">Kraków</a> but I work across time and space.
