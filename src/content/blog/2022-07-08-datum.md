![Different options of a datum](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/webpub/img/datum.png)

Datum is a concept of a reference point in architecture. In user interfaces, web and app alike, we also have a concept of datum. It manifests itself as a technological fabric (the reference pint of how HTML is laid out), basic design priciples (grid), and stylistic choices for a particular project (symetry, contrast, key visual elemets).

Datum is critical for building:

- grounding from technology (using the technology to render it, like web or native) and design (grid, rythm) perspective
- establishing reference points (headers, title bar, navigaion)
- guiding attention (key visuals, contrast)

In the end, notes are meaningless without the musical scale lines.
